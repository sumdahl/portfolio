# Welcome to My Portfolio

I'm excited to share my new portfolio website with you! This site showcases my projects, skills, and technical writing.

## Technologies Used

This portfolio is built with modern web technologies:

- **Next.js 16** with App Router
- **TypeScript** for type safety
- **Tailwind CSS** for styling
- **Bun** as the runtime
- **MDX** for blog posts

## Features

### Custom MDX Blog System

I've built a custom blog system that supports:

- Live preview while writing
- Syntax highlighting for code blocks
- Reading time estimation
- Tags and categories

### GitHub Integration

The portfolio integrates with GitHub's GraphQL API to display:

- Contribution heatmap
- Featured repositories
- Activity statistics

### Dark Mode First

The design is dark-mode-first, using a carefully selected color palette that's easy on the eyes while maintaining excellent contrast for readability.

## What's Next?

I'll be regularly updating this blog with technical articles, tutorials, and insights from my development journey. Stay tuned!

```typescript
// Example code block
function greet(name: string): string {
  return `Hello, ${name}!`;
}

console.log(greet("World"));
```

Thanks for visiting!
